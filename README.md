# Wine Quality Prediction 
Data Analysis Project on Wine Quality Prediction

# Problem Description
Wine quality rating is usually depending on sensory testing -> highly subjective.  
It affects the speed and accuracy of wine quality rating.  

# Objective  
Remove as much subjectivity from the wine quality process and create a system to accurately and promptly rate wine quality.  

# How to achieve our objective 
Creating predictive models using multi prediction techniques, decision trees and KNN to forecast wine preferences and classify quality of white and red wine samples.  

# About the Data 

Dataset was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Contains wine samples produced in Portugal.  
4898 varieties with different  chemical properties as 12 variables.  
Quality - int type & and Other 11 numeric type.  
Target Variable:  Quality is the response variable ranging from 0-9 score. Quality has more values concentrated in 5,6 & 7 and lesser at the extremities.  

# Model Selection and Evaluation 
Linear Regression, Random Forest and KNN algorithms used.   
K- fold cross validation technique showed that KNN was the best model for this dataset.
